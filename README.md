# Pacman-Game

# Pacman in Python with PyGame
* This is a very minimal implementation of the Pacman game, having only one level and without ghosts strategy, not even with random movements (yes, the routes are programmed). 
* However, we may improve this game in the future and everyone else interested can feel free to fork and contribute to this project.

# Tested with [Python 2.7 in Ubuntu 14.04.3] and [Python 3.5 in Windows 10 64bit]
